You need [<b>OpenFrameworks</b>] (http://openframeworks.cc/) to use some special function and interface.

Moreover , you can download your favorite background , avator and music.

Here is some feature can be added :

* AI for singleGame 
  (automatic interface has been designed , all you need is write a heuristic function , return the movement array)

* Special effect for attack (I don't have any talent about art...OTL)

* Some special requirement for removing pearls (like candy crush (? )
